# CCNA Prep Lab

Hi everyone! Welcome to my CCNA Prep Lab repository. I’m currently preparing for the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) exam and have put together a collection of Packet Tracer labs inspired by Jeremy’s IT Lab and his amazing resources. These labs are my hands-on approach to mastering core networking concepts, and I hope they can help others in their study journey as well!

# What’s Inside:

A variety of network simulation exercises designed to reinforce CCNA topics.
Practical, scenario-based configurations focusing on routing, switching, and more.
Ongoing updates as I progress through the curriculum.
Getting Started:

# Clone or download this repository.
Open the included .pkt files using Cisco Packet Tracer.
Experiment with the provided topologies and configurations—or modify them to create your own!
# Why These Labs?

They’re a fun way to practice CCNA-level concepts in a safe environment.
Inspired by Jeremy’s IT Lab, they serve as a foundation to deepen understanding of networking fundamentals.
Perfect for self-study, group practice, or supplemental learning alongside official training materials.
Feel free to explore, contribute, or share feedback. Let’s learn and grow together in our CCNA journey!

# Happy Networking!
